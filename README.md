# snake-rs

This game is heavily inspired by my favorite terminal screensaver `github.com/pipeseroni/pipes.sh` in terms of UI. I made this because I have always wanted to control the pipes when running `pipes.sh` like in the classic snake game. This game is targeted to serve as a fun program to interact with on the terminal without a goal or objective, so there is no way to lose (thus it is on "zen mode").
